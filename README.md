# Blázar

> Blázar is a client-facing retail web-portal designed and modernized to fulfill business requirements. An interactive user interface was created allowing customers to browse items in our retail catalog.

#### Product Detail
> The top-most section on the Product Detail page. This component will guide the customer through selecting a specific style and size to add to their cart.

#### Related Items & Outfit Creation
> The Related Items section will display two sets of related products. The first set will be a list of products, determined internally, that are related to the product currently being viewed. The second set will be a list, custom created by the user, of products which the user has grouped with the current product into an ‘outfit’.
